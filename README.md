Welcome to my coding journey at Redis University! :books::tada: Here, you'll find the results of my hands-on exercises, experiments, and eureka moments as I navigate the fascinating world of Redis.

### :brain: What's Inside

#### [:rocket: RU301 -- Running Redis at Scale](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru301/)

Scaling means more than just performance. This course is divided into the following units covering topics around scaling Redis for production deployment.

1. Persistence/Durability: options persisting Redis data to disk.
2. High Availability: how to make sure Redis and your data is always there.
3. Scalability: scaling Redis for both higher throughput and capacity.
4. Observability: visibility into your Redis deployment (metrics, etc.).

### :man_technologist: Why You Should Explore

- :earth_asia: Learn with Me: Join me on this educational journey as I grapple with concepts and uncover the beauty of Redis.
- :hammer_and_wrench: Hands-on Coding: It's not just theory; it's hands-on coding. Witness the evolution of my skills and Redis mastery.
- :handshake: Community Collaboration: Contribute, suggest improvements, or simply cheer from the sidelines.

### :star2: Get Started

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tlvu2697/redis-university-playground.git`
2. Explore the folders and dive into the code snippets.
3. Share your thoughts, insights, or even your own Redis discoveries.

###### :pushpin: Disclaimer -- expect a mix of "Aha!" moments, occasional head-scratching, and a lot of code enthusiasm.
